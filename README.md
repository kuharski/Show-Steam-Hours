# show-steam-hours

You can get your own personal Steam Web API key here, https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey. You will need this key to fetch your account information. Your Steam ID can be found under "Account details" in the desktop application. Under "Privacy Settings" when editing your profile, you must also set your "Game details" to "Public".

I used a local MySQL database to store the data. I also used Python libraries NumPy and Matplotlib to visualize the data in addition to providing a detailed printout containing exact hours.

Below I've included a visualization of my own Steam hours (yes, I know a thing or two about Civilization VI)
